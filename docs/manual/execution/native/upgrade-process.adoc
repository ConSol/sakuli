Before you upgrade your current Sakuli installation, please ensure that you have read the <<changelog>>.

Execute `__SAKULI_HOME__/../Uninstaller/uninstaller.jar` to remove the current installed version. This will only affect the files in `__SAKULI_HOME__`. The uninstaller removes all installed files, and resets the environment configuration.

After that just install the new version.

If you have some errors with your Linux installation, you can check the following points:

[[gnome-session-flashback]]
====== Install GNOME session flashback theme

NOTE: Before Ubuntu 16.04 the package name was `gnome-session-fallback`

Sakuli can test on Unity, of course - but https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/GNOME_Flashback[gnome-session-flashback] is more than sufficient and has the advantage that 3D effects and shadowing won't break your test.

Install and set `gnome-seesion-flashback` as default:
[source,bash]
----
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y gnome-session-flashback
    echo "[SeatDefaults]" >> /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
    echo "user-session=gnome-flashback-metacity" >> /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
----

After the installation, relogin/restart and ensure that the desktop environment *GNOME Flashback (Metacity)* is selected:

image:u_flashback.jpg[flashback]

The Ubuntu menu bar should have changed now to the "classical" one:

====== Restore gsettings key bindings

In headless checks you will encounter problems using the `TAB` key as well as `s`:

* The TAB key will switch applications (like `ALT + TAB`)
* `s` will open the applications menu

For some reason (?), gsettings binds `s` and `TAB` to the `Super key` by default. Open a terminal as the Sakuli user and execute the following commands to restore that to the default:

[source]
----
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-applications "['<Alt>Tab']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings panel-main-menu "['<Alt>F1']"
----

If you have some errors with your Linux installation, you can check the following points:

====== Install GNOME session fallback theme

Sakuli can test on Unity, of course - but https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gnome-session-fallback/[gnome-session-fallback] is more than sufficientâ€¦ 

`sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback`

After the installation, relogin and select the desktop environment *GNOME Flashback (Metacity)*:

The Ubuntu menu bar should have changed now to the "classical" one:

====== Restore gsettings key bindings

In headless checks you will encounter problems using the `TAB` key as well as `s`:

* The TAB key will switch applications (like `ALT + TAB`)
* `s` will open the applications menu

For some reason (?), gsettings binds `s` and `TAB` to the `Super key` by default. Open a terminal as the Sakuli user and execute the following commands to restore that to the default:

[source]
----
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-applications "['<Alt>Tab']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings panel-main-menu "['<Alt>F1']"

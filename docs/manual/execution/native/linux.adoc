===== Installation

This page describes the steps to *install and test* Sakuli on *Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS*.
For other distributions (CentOS, OpenSuSE, ...) they be mostly identical. If you want to *update* Sakuli, see the link:upgrade-process.adoc[upgrade process] documentation.

The default installation path of a particular Sakuli version is referenced as `$SAKULI_HOME` (also called the "_version_" folder) which is inside of the folder "sakuli":

[source]
----
> echo $SAKULI_HOME
  /opt/sakuli/sakuli-v1.1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

Values surrounded by double underscores are have to be filled individually by you (e.g. `__IP_ADDRESS__`).

====== Machine requirements
You can run Sakuli on physical as well as on virtual Linux machines.

* *Linux OS* (here: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Desktop)
* *64 Bit* (recommended)
* *RAM*: 2GB or more
* *CPU*: at least two CPU cores

====== Software requirements

`sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre tesseract-ocr wmctrl xdotool`

====== Recommendations

* Set the desktop background to a homogenous color.
* disable any screen locking mechanisms
* Run Sakuli with a dedicated user
* Sakuli needs a reliable and predictable desktop environment: make sure that there are no pop-up windows of services or applications
* If Sakuli is running within a VM, change the desktop resolution to a fixed value (e.g. 1024x768) and disable any auto-resizing mechanisms of the guest display. This ensures that the guest's resolution does not change in case that you resize its window.
* Other optional steps see <<gnome-session-fallback>>.
* the client should *not* have more than one physical screen

====== Sakuli installation

* Download the *Sakuli Installer* from http://labs.consol.de/sakuli/install[http://labs.consol.de/sakuli/install]
* current *development* snapshot = `sakuli-vX.X.X-SNAPSHOT-installer.jar`
* current *stable* version = `sakuli-vX.X.X-installer.jar` (recommended)

Execute `java -jar sakuli-vX.X.X-installer.jar` to start the installer:

image:installer_1_linux.png[inst_1]

Read and accept the licence, choose the installation folder (any path the current user has _rw_ permissions is ok) and select the packages to install:

image:installer_2_linux.png[inst_2]

. install Sakuli
. install Sahi
. set/update the environment variable `$SAKULI_HOME` which points to the new version.
. set/update `.bashc`
. install one example test suite per OS which help you to test and understand Sakuli.
. install Firefox Portable, which can be used exclusively for Sakuli Tests

In the end you are offered to generate a headless installation file which can be executed on other hosts with:

[source]
----
java -jar sakuli-vX.X.X-installer.jar auto-config.xml
----

====== Test

Now test if Sahi can start a Sahi-controlled browser.

Execute `$SAKULI_HOME/sahi/userdata/bin/start_dashboard.sh` to open the *Sahi Dashboard*. It should now list all available browsers on this system.

image:inst_dashboard_linux.png[dashboards]

Click on any browser icon, it should start and present you the start page of Sahi:

image:sahi_startpage.jpg[sahi_start]

At last, test the *Sahi Controller* by holding the *ALT key* and double-clicking on any white space on the page. If you are getting a new window showing the "Sahi Controller", you're done. Close all browser windows and Sahi.

image:installer_4_l.png[controller_linux]

NOTE: On Linux deskops the ALT key is often predefined to drag windows. In this case, open `$SAKULI_HOME/sahi/config/sahi.properties` and change the "hotkey" property:

[source]
----
controller.hotkey=SHIFT
----

You are now ready to run the *first minimal Sakuli test* to see if Sakuli and its components are working well together. Open a new terminal to start a test:

[source,bash]
----
sakuli run __INST_DIR__/example_test_suites/example_ubuntu/
----

Sakuli should now

. open *Firefox* with the Sakuli welcome page, highlight some page elements
. open the *calculator* and calculate _525+100=625_
. open an *editor* and write a *status message*



===== Additional documentation

* If you are sitting behing a company proxy, refer to <<sahi_behind_a_proxy>>.
* Refer to <<sahi-browser-configuration>> for instructions how to register other browsers.

===== Optional software


====== PhantomJS

Currently, _each_ Sakuli test requires to start a browser, which is not very handy for pure Sikuli GUI tests (=where no browser at all is needed). For that case, use a headless browser like http://phantomjs.org[PhantomJS]. Refer to <<sahi-browser-configuration>> for more information.

Attention: PhantomJS 2 is currently unsupported. Use version 1.9.x

====== Screenshot tool

Use a screenshot tool which is able to

* capture areas of the screen
* delay the creation of screenshots for x seconds (important if Sikuli must navigate through menues)

A good choice is

* http://shutter-project.org/[Shutter] on *Linux*.
* https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Scrot/[Scrot] on *Linux* (lightweight, cli-based).

Always make sure that screenshots are saved without compression. Sikuli uses a default similarity of 0.99, which internally means that "more than 99%" =&gt; 100% pixels must conincide. Decreasing similarity should only be neccessary if the pattern images are of poor quality or the region compared to always slightly differs from the pattern image.

====== Editor

It is recommended to use an Editor with JavaScript support, e.g. https://atom.io[Atom]

It also possible to use professional programming IDEs like https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ], https://netbeans.org/[Netbeans] or https://eclipse.org[Eclipse].


===== Next steps

* Read our link:first-steps.md[first-steps tutorial] and learn to handle Sakuli
* Integrate Sakuli results in monitoring systems:
** <<omd-gearman>>
** <<omd-sql-database>>
** <<icinga2-integration>>
//FIXME: check_mk

* Sakuli can also be integrated in *continuous integration* environments like <<jenkins-integration>>

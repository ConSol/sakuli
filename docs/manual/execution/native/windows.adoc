===== Installation

This page describes the steps to *install and test* Sakuli on *Windows*.
If you want to *update* Sakuli, see the link:upgrade-process.adoc[upgrade process] documentation.

The default installation path of a particular Sakuli version is referenced as `%SAKULI_HOME%` (also called the "_version_" folder) which is inside of the folder "sakuli":

[source]
----
> echo %SAKULI_HOME%
  C:\Program Files (x86)\sakuli\sakuli-v1.1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

Values surrounded by double underscores are have to be filled individually by you (e.g. `__IP_ADDRESS__`).

====== Machine requirements

You can run Sakuli on physical as well as on virtual Linux machines.

* *OS*: *Microsoft Windows* (version 7 and higher)
* *64 Bit* (recommended)
* *RAM*: 2GB or more
* *CPU*: at least two CPU cores
* *Software:*
* Java JRE &gt;= 1.8

====== Recommendations

* Set the desktop background to a homogenous color.
* disable any screen locking mechanisms
* Run Sakuli with a dedicated user
* Sakuli needs a reliable and predictable desktop environment: make sure that there are no pop-up windows of services or applications
* If Sakuli is running within a VM, change the desktop resolution to a fixed value (e.g. 1024x768) and disable any auto-resizing mechanisms of the guest display. This ensures that the guest's resolution does not change in case that you resize its window.
* the client should *not* have more than one physical screen

====== Sakuli installation

* Download the *Sakuli Installer* from http://labs.consol.de/sakuli/install[http://labs.consol.de/sakuli/install]
* current *development* snapshot = `sakuli-vX.X.X-SNAPSHOT-installer.jar`
* current *stable* version = `sakuli-vX.X.X-installer.jar` (recommended)

Double-click on the downloaded .jar file to start the installer:

image:installer_1.png[inst_1]

Read and accept the licence, choose the installation folder (any path the current user has _rw_ permissions is ok) and select the packages to install:

image:installer_2.png[inst_2]

. install Sakuli
. install Sahi
. set/update the environment variable `%SAKULI_HOME%` to the new version.
. set/update environment settings which have proved as best practice for UI tests.
. install one example test suite per OS which help you to test and understand Sakuli.
. install Firefox Portable, which can be used exclusively for Sakuli Tests.
. install http://sourceforge.net/projects/qres/[QRes], a open source screen mode changer (Windows only)

In the end you are offered to generate a headless installation file which can be executed on other hosts with:

[source]
----
java -jar sakuli-vX.X.X-installer.jar auto-config.xml
----

Reboot now to take the registry changes effect.

====== Test

Now test if Sahi can start a Sahi-controlled browser.

Execute `%SAKULI_HOME%\sahi\userdata\bin\start_dashboard.bat` to open the *Sahi Dashboard*. It should now list all available browsers on this system.

image:inst_dashboard.png[dashboards]

Click on any browser icon: it should start and present you the start page of Sahi:

image:sahi_startpage.png[sahi_start]

At last, test the *Sahi Controller* by holding the *ALT key* and double-clicking on any white space on the page. If you are getting a new window showing the "Sahi Controller", you're done. Close all browser windows and Sahi.

You are now ready to run the *first minimal Sakuli test* to see if Sakuli and its components are working well together. Open a new terminal to start a test:

* *Windows 7*: `sakuli run __INST_DIR__\example_test_suites\example_windows7\`
* *Windows 8*: `sakuli run __INST_DIR__\example_test_suites\example_windows8\`

Sakuli should now

. open *Firefox* with the Sakuli welcome page, highlight some page elements
. open the *calculator* and calculate _525+100=625_
. open an *editor* and write a *status message*


===== Additional documentation:

* If you are sitting behing a company proxy, refer to <<sahi_behind_a_proxy>>.
* Refer to <<sahi-browser-configuration>> for instructions how to register other browsers.

===== Optional software
====== PhantomJS

Currently, _each_ Sakuli test requires to start a browser, which is not very handy for pure Sikuli GUI tests (=where no browser at all is needed). For that case, use a headless browser like http://phantomjs.org[PhantomJS]. Refer to <<sahi-browser-configuration>> for more information.

Attention: PhantomJS 2 is currently unsupported. Use version 1.9.x

====== Screenshot tool

Use a screenshot tool which is able to

* capture areas of the screen
* delay the creation of screenshots for x seconds (important if Sikuli must navigate through menues)

A good choice is

* http://www.getgreenshot.org[Greenshot] on *Windows*

Always make sure that screenshots are saved without compression. Sikuli uses a default similarity of 0.99, which internally means that "more than 99%" =&gt; 100% pixels must conincide. Decreasing similarity should only be neccessary if the pattern images are of poor quality or the region compared to always slightly differs from the pattern image.

====== Editor

It is recommended to use an Editor with JavaScript support, e. g. http://notepad-plus-plus.org/[Notepad++]

It also possible to use professional programming IDEs like https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ], https://netbeans.org/[Netbeans] or https://eclipse.org[Eclipse].

* Integrate Sakuli results in monitoring systems:
** <<omd-integration-native>>
** <<icinga2-integration>>
//FIXME: check_mk

* Sakuli can also be integrated in *continuous integration* environments like <<jenkins-integration>>

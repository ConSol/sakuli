==== OpenShift
[#git-edit-section]
:page-path: docs/manual/execution/containerized/openshift.adoc
git-link:{page-path}{git-view} | git-link:{page-path}{git-edit}

The following section describes how to use link:https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift] for Sakuli E2E testing and monitoring.
The following content uses as example the image `consol/sakuli-ubuntu-xfce` of the Dockerfile `git-link:docker/Dockerfile.sakuli.ubuntu.xfce[link-text="Dockerfile.sakuli.ubuntu.xfce", mode="view", link-window="_blank"]`.

First you have to create your OpenShift project on the command line:

[source]
----
cd openshift
oc new-project my-project
----

Then you can use the provided templates from `git-link:docker/openshift[link-text="docker/openshift", mode="view", link-window="_blank"]`.

[[openshift-run-image]]
===== Run image from Dockerhub

[source]
----
cd openshift
oc new-project my-project
----

As soon as you are logged in to OpenShift and have selected your project, you can simply run the image by using the configuration `git-link:docker/openshift/openshift.sakuli.example.pod.run.yaml[link-text="openshift.sakuli.example.pod.run.yaml", mode="view", link-window="_blank"]`:

[source]
----
oc process -f openshift.sakuli.example.pod.run.yaml -v E2E_TEST_NAME=single-pod | oc create -f -
----

After the deployment you will see the new deployed service on the OpenShift management UI :

[source]
----
https://__YOUR-OS-MANAGEMENT-URL__/console/project/my-project/overview`
----

image:os_run_only.png[openshift management consol run-only service]

Watch the test execution within the container with this URL:

[source]
----
http://my-run-only-pod-my-project.__YOUR-OS-URL__/?password=sakuli`
----

image:os_container_webvnc.png[openshift container via webvnc]

If you want to use another Sakuli image (here: Ubuntu) just use the `IMAGE` var:

[source]
----
oc process -f openshift.sakuli.example.pod.run.yaml -v E2E_TEST_NAME=single-pod -v IMAGE=consol/sakuli-ubuntu-icewm | oc create -f -
----

===== Build &amp; run your own image

If you want to build the image in your own infrastructure just use the configuration `git-link:docker/openshift/openshift.sakuli.example.image.build.yaml[link-text="openshift.sakuli.example.image.build.yaml", mode="view", link-window="_blank"]`:

[source]
----
oc process -f openshift.sakuli.example.image.build.yaml -v IMAGE=sakuli-oc-image | oc create -f -
----

Alternatively you can build a custom Docker image in a specific branch:

[source]
----
oc process -f openshift.sakuli.example.image.build.yaml \
    -v IMAGE=sakuli-oc-image-icewm \
    -v SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF=dev \
    -v SOURCE_DOCKERFILE=Dockerfile.sakuli.ubuntu.icewm \
    | oc create -f -
----

====== Use images from oc docker registry

To use an already builded image from the internal OpenShift registry you have to specify the image in the pattern `<registry-ip>/<your-project>/<image-name>[:<tag>]`:

[source]
----
oc process -f openshift.sakuli.example.pod.run.yaml -v IMAGE=10.0.0.X:5000/my-project/sakuli-oc-image,E2E_TEST_NAME=oc-image-test-2 | oc create -f -
----

===== Run git based tests

====== Git based test definitions on volume mounts

An effective way to execute your own Sakuli tests is that you mount the testsuite into the container. For this you can use the template `openshift.sakuli.gitvolume.pod.run.yaml`. The template will checkout the git repository and mount it as a read-only volume into the container where Sakuli will execute it:

[source]
----
oc process -f openshift.sakuli.gitvolume.pod.run.yaml \
    -v GIT_TEST_SUITE_REPO=https://github.com/ConSol/sakuli-examples \
    -v GIT_TEST_SUITE_PATH=docker-xfce/part_01/example_xfce \
    | oc create -f -
----

IMPORTANT: If something went wrong, you maybe have to enable this volume type in the cluster - see next section.

====== Enable gitRepo volumes:

Login as administrator:

[source]
----
oc login -u system:admin
----

Edit the security :

[source]
----
oc edit securitycontextconstraints/restricted
----

add `gitRepo` to `volumes`:

[source]
----
volumes:
- configMap
- downwardAPI
- emptyDir
- persistentVolumeClaim
- secret
- gitRepo
----

===== Job Config
Currently OpenShift (Version 3.5) have no different behaviour as Kubernetes itself, so take a look at <<kubernetes-job-config>>.

[[openshift-s2i]]
===== OpenShift source to image (S2I)
It's possible to use all the features of Sakuli combined with the power of
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[OpenShift S2I].
This empowers you to create s2i base images configured as you desire. The only thing you have to do is to add your test
suite to the runnable sakuli test environment by configuration. Please find an example
link:docker/openshift/openshift.sakuli.s2i.image.build.yaml[s2i build config template]
in our template section. This template will provide you a build config and a image stream containing the Sakuli S2I
image, so that you can easily build up the Sakuli test container for your suites. In addition, we provide a
link:docker/openshift/openshift.sakuli.s2i.build.yaml[Sakuli test container template]
to create ready to run Sakuli container, based on Sakuli S2I, using the previously defined S2I image stream, running the
configured suite.

====== Advantages of Sakuli S2I
Beside the general advantages of OpenShift S2I, Sakuli S2I adds additional ones in terms of test automation.

* Keep the test suites close to your applications code and reference the suits in the build config.
* If the tests change, you just have to start a new build of your Sakuli test container.
* Reduces CI/CD pipeline processing time by just updating the suite in the sakuli container environment.

====== Modify the base image
The
link:docker/openshift/openshift.sakuli.s2i.build.yaml[Sakuli test container template]
provides the possibility to exchange the base image of your Sakuli test environment, so that all available
link:docs/manual/execution/containerized/docker-images.adoc[base images]
can be used.

[source]
----
oc process -f openshift.sakuli.s2i.build.yaml -p "BASE_IMAGE=consol/sakuli-ubuntu-xfce"
----

In terms that you have designed your own Sakuli base image, you're also able to define the Source where the image
should be taken from.

[source]
----
oc process -f openshift.sakuli.s2i.build.yaml -p "BASE_IMAGE=my-sakuli-ubuntu-openbox" -p "BASE_IMAGE_KIND=ImageStream"
----

The values available in the `BASE_IMAGE_KIND` correlate to the values of the `dockerStrategy.from.kind` definition.

===== Other useful commands

====== Delete specific application or E2E test

[source]
----
oc process -f openshift.sakuli.example.pod.run.yaml -v E2E_TEST_NAME=single-job | oc delete --grace-period=5 -f -
----

====== Delete all running pods and configs

[source]
----
oc delete dc --all && oc delete routes --all && oc delete pods --all && oc delete services --all && oc delete jobs --all
----

==== Screenshot history

INFO: This section applies to http://http://labs.consol.de/OMD/[OMD-Labs] and the web interface https://www.thruk.org/[Thruk]. To use the screenshot history functionality on other platforms/web interfaces, the steps may vary.

===== Feature description
In case of an exception, Sakuli takes a screenshot of the current screen and embeds this image into the *service output* (base64 encoded). The user is able to view the screenshot on the monitoring user interface.

The drawback of this method is that the screenshot only resists in the monitoring core's memory; as soon as the test recovers, the test output changes back to OK and the image is gone. There are the Nagios/Naemon event logs to inspect former exceptions, but they do not contain the screenshots (fortunately).

With the *Screenshot history* feature, the monitoring core (Nagios/Naemon/Icinga) fires a event handler script each time the check has a CRITICAL result. The script analyzes the service output, parses the image data and stores it on the local file system within a folder structure published by the OMD site apache process. Sakuli services contain a https://www.thruk.org/documentation/action-menu.html[Thruk action menu] which allow the user to see all saved screenshots.

===== Activating the feature

Use the Makefile located in `$OMD_ROOT/share/sakuli/` to enable the feature:

[source,bash]
----
OMD[demo]:~/share/sakuli/setup$ make screenshot_history
cp ./omd/local/lib/nagios/plugins/sakuli_screenshot_eventhandler.sh /omd/sites/demo/local/lib/nagios/plugins/
cp ./omd/etc/nagios/conf.d/sakuli_screenshot_eventhandler.cfg /omd/sites/demo/etc/core/conf.d/
cp ./omd/local/bin/sakuli_screenshot_cleanup.sh /omd/sites/demo/local/bin/
cp ./omd/etc/cron.d/sakuli_screenshot_cleanup /omd/sites/demo/etc/cron.d/
cp ./omd/etc/thruk/ssi/*.ssi /omd/sites/demo/etc/thruk/ssi/
cp ./omd/etc/thruk/thruk_local.d/sakuli_action_menu.conf /omd/sites/demo/etc/thruk/thruk_local.d/

===== Event handler
Now assign the command `sakuli_screenshot_eventhandler` to all Sakuli services:

[source]
----
define service {
  service_description            example_xfce
  host_name                      sakuli_client
  use                            tpl_s_sakuli_gearman_grafana
  event_handler                  sakuli_screenshot_eventhandler
  event_handler_enabled          1
}
----

Each time a CRITICAL Sakuli result comes in, the eventhandler will log its actions:

[source]
----
OMD[demo]:$ tail -f var/log/sakuli_screenshot_eventhandler.log
...

===== Thruk action_menu
Open `$OMD_ROOT/etc/thruk/thruk_local.d/sakuli_action_menu.conf` and adapt the section `<action_menu_apply>`. The following example applies the action_menu only on services whose host names begin with "sakuli". See the https://www.thruk.org/documentation/configuration.html#action-menu-settings[Thruk documentation for more examples].

[source]
----
# Apply the action_menu on all services of hosts starting with "sakuli"
<action_menu_apply>
     sakuli_history_menu = ^sakuli.*;.+$
</action_menu_apply>
----

After reloading the web server you should see a small dropdown arrow on each Sakuli service, giving you access to the screenshot history lightbox:

image:screenshot_hist_action_menu.png[screenshot_hist_action_menu]

image:screenshot_hist_lightbox.png[screenshot_hist_lightbox,500]

The lightbox always shows the last/current screenshot and the error message. To navigate forth/back, use the left/right arrow keys or the buttons in the bottom right corner. Press Esc to close the box again.

===== Grafana integration
Read the <<screenshot_annotations,Grafana screenshot annotations>> section if you want to integrate the screnshots as Grafana annotations.

NOTE: For PNP4Nagios there is no such feature available.

If you want to run tests which do not include any web technology, you can use phantomJS instead of firefox/chrome/IE and use the Sahi default start URL:

.testsuite.suite

----
case1/sakuli_demo.js http://sahi.example.com/_s_/dyn/Driver_initialized

NOTE: Sakuli depends on Sahi running, which in turn needs a running browser instance. Using PhantomJS for this, hides the browser window completely.

TIP: Use the Sahi Controller to identify elements on the page to write and test Sahi methods!

There are two ways to get Sahi instructions into your testcase `your-testcase.js`:

* identify, copy &amp; paste from the Sahi Controller
* record by the Sahi Controller, copy &amp; paste from the file, see <<sahi-recorder>>

[[sahi-open-controller]]
.Open the Sahi Controller

Add to your testcase the following line, at position where you want to identify your HTML object:

[source,js]
----
//.... your testcode
env.sleep(9999);
----

Then start your test suite and the Sakuli test should appear and stop at that position for 9999 seconds. The "sleep" statement is a nice trick when writing long tests; wherever you put a 9999s sleep in, the test will execute until this position and wait. Think of it like a breakpoint when debugging a program.

Now open the Sahi Controller (hold the `ALT` key on Windows or `CTRL + ALT` on Linux and doubleclick anywhere on the page) to open this window:

[[sahi-controller-copy-paste]]
.copy/paste code

First, we want Sahi to check if there is for example the Sakuli Logo on the page. Hold the `CTRL` key and move the mouse pointer on the logo. Watch the Sahi Controller: it detects the HTML elements below the mouse pointer and generates the http://sahipro.com/docs/sahi-apis/accessor-apis.html#_image[accessor method for "image"] automatically:

image:tutorial_logo_accessor.png[logo_accessor]

Click on "Assert" to let Sahi autogenerate http://sahipro.com/docs/sahi-apis/assertions.html[assertion methods]:

image:tutorial_assert2.png[assert]

Just copy the second line (which checks the visibility of an element) into the clipboard and paste it into your testcase `your-testcase.js` before the `env.sleep(9999)` statement.

Further, we want for example to assure that the contact form of the web page os displayed correctly. Move the mouse pointer down to the "Kontakt" link; Sahi should display the accessor `_image(&quot;Kontakt zu ConSol&quot;)`

. This time use the "click" button on the controller
. To execute a click; this also generates the complete http://sahipro.com/docs/sahi-apis/action-apis.html[browser action] statement
. copy/paste also into the test case

image:tutorial_click_action.png[click]

In the end, Sahi should check that the appeared popup window contains the text "Schreiben Sie uns!". You guessed it - move the mouse pointer over this text and click the "Assert" button again. The fourth assertion is the right one, which we also paste into the test script: 

image:tutorial_contains_text.png[contains_text]

Now remove the "sleep" statement from the script file; it should look now like that: 

[source,js]
----
_dynamicInclude($includeFolder);
var testCase = new TestCase(60, 70);
var env = new Environment()

try{
    //your code
    _assert(_isVisible(_image("sakuli.png")));
    _click(_image("Kontakt zu conSol"));
    _assertContainsText("Schreiben Sie uns!", _heading3("Schreiben Sie uns!"));
    //env.sleep(9999);

} catch (e) {
    testCase.handleException(e);
} finally {
    testCase.saveResult();
}
----

TIP: Perhaps you want Sahi to highlight the items it is acting on: just use the `_highlight()` method from the http://sahipro.com/docs/sahi-apis/debug-helper-apis.html[debug helper API] to mark each element with a red border before accessing it: `_highlight(_image("sakuli.png"));`

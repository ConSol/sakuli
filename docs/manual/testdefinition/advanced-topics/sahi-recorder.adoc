Another method to <<sahi-controller-copy-paste>> is to record all steps into a file. For this, open the Sahi controller (<<sahi-open-controller>>), enter a filename and click on "record":

NOTE: actions like clicks are written to file automatically. All other actions like assertions can be written to file by clicking the button "Append to Script": image:tutorial_append.png[sahi_recorder_append_to_script]

After you have clicked on "stop", open the recorded file, copy everything and paste the lines in to the Sakuli testcase `your-testcase.js` file.

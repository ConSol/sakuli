====== Solution 1: accept self-signed certificates

This will work on most systems, especially the ones you have full control over.

. Open Sahi Dashboard, start the browser.
. On the Sahi start page, navigate to the https site you want Sahi to trust (e.g. https://github.com[https://github.com])
. You will be presented a message that this page "connection is not secure/trusted".
. On *Firefox*, click *"I understand the risks."*
. On *Chrome*, click *"Proceed anyway (unsecure)"*
. On *IE*, click *"Continue to the website (not recommended)"*.
. Once the page has loaded, click *"SSL Manager"* from the Sahi start page
. You should be presented a green check mark right of the https URL, indicating that Chrome accepted the site's certificate, signed by Sahi:

You will be promptet again a security warning for connecting to "sahi.example.com" (a local dummy domain), add the certificate here also as an exception.

The following page contains a list of all so far trusted and untrusted domains and their certificates. To import the red marked into the browser's certificate store, open the links by clicking them with the middle mouse key. This opens the page within a new tab; only in this way you are allowed to add the certificate exception.

You can close every opened tab when it is displaying "Successfully connected" for the domain:

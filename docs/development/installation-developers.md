# Installation guide for Sakuli - Developers

## Requirements
For the following guide you need

* Access to the issue-tracker tool (currently JIRA)
* Git
* Development environment (we advise IntelliJ IDEA)
* Maven 3 ( __attention for Ubuntu users!!!__ - don't use the default maven version over `apt-get install mvn` )
* Java JDK 1.8
  * Please use the original Oracle JDK - OpenJDK unfortunately won't work for the JavaFX based integration test, see [Java FX installation](java_fx_installation).
  * Ensure that your `JAVA_HOME` system variable links to the correct jdk-version


## Sakuli Setup
### Import
* Check out the project via git
* Import the project as a maven-project

### Maven Settings
* Ensure that you have at least installed maven 3, run `mvn --version`
* Config the local maven settings `~/.m2/settings.xml` for your environment as follows:

     ```
     <settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                           http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

     <server>
         <id>labs-consol-sakuli-install</id>
         <username>sakuli</username>
         <privateKey>${user.home}/.ssh/your-key-file</privateKey>
     </server>

     <server>
         <id>labs-consol-sakuli-repository</id>
         <username>maven-repository</username>
         <privateKey>${user.home}/.ssh/your-key-file</privateKey>
     </server>

     </settings>

     ```

### Install Sahi
* Download Sahi5 from https://labs.consol.de/sakuli/install/3rd-party and execute the sahi installation:

    ```
    java -jar install_sahi_v50_20141105.jar.jar
    ```

* Install Sahi into `<project-dir>/sahi`. Ensure that this path is set in `sahi.proxy.homePath` in file `sakuli.properties`.

* You only need to install the components
	* Sahi Core
	* Tools
	* Userdata

### Database Setup (optional, only needed [database forwarder](../../docs/forwarder-database.md))
Setup a local MySQL database to save the results of test case executions. The database won't be needed for running `mvn install`.

* __User:__ `sakuli`
* __Password:__ `sakuli`
* __Database:__ `sakuli`
* __SQL-Script:__ [create_sakuli_database](../../src/sakuli-common/src/main/resources/org/sakuli/common/setup/database/create_sakuli_database.sql)

If you want to use a Docker-Container, you can build and run it with the following commands:

    cd src/common/src/main/resources/org/sakuli/common/setup/database/create_sakuli_database
    docker build -t=your-user/mysql-sakuli .
    docker run --name mysql-sakuli -p 3306:3306 your-user/mysql-sakuli

### IDE configuration

* Execute `mvn clean verify` to ensure that the setup is correct
* Include the license header to your IDE
  * For IntelliJ see [Help](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/generating-and-updating-copyright-notice.html) or our predefined copyright configuration under [intellij/copyright](intellij/copyright).
  * License Header:

    ```
* In order to run Sakuli test cases directly from the IDE, you need to build up a run configuration. For IntelliJ see the predefined run configurations under [intellij/runConfigurations](intellij/runConfigurations)
  * __classpath of module:__ `sakuli-core`
  * __working directory:__ `$MODULE_DIR$`
  * __main class:__ `org.sakuli.starter.SakuliStarter`
  * __program arguments:__
    ```-run <path to your Sakuli test suite folder> --sakuli_home <path to your "main" folder> --sahi_home <path to your sahi folder>```
    e.g. for the provided Win7 example use `-run ../sakuli_test_suites/example src/main/_include ../sahi`

* To run the testng tests correctly and prevent wrong file paths, set the default TestNG config like follow:

### Important note: startup error
If you run your Sakuli test the first time, you might get a native library error, caused by Sikuli, saying that it could not find the correct native library to work with. At the same time, Sikuli already tried to fix the problem by modyfing PATH.  
Just log out and in again, so that the modified PATH-Variable will be read. Sakuli should start now without any error.

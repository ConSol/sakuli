# Installation guide for Sakuli under Windows 7
You probably came from the page "Introduction" - if not, and if you are nor sure what Sakuli is, please read first [README](../README.md). 

## Prerequisites
The following installation manual assumes that...

* you have a fresh installed Windows 7 (Home/Professional/whatever) machine in front of you. 
* all OS updates and drivers are installed
* this machine has access to the internet
* the local firewall is disabled
* there is a user account (e.g. "sakuli") with admin rights; if possible, disable any mechanism which can lock the account after x false login attempts. 
* for best results, there is no service/application running which could show dialogues which could disturbe e2e checks (e.g. messages indicating a scheduled antivirus scan, custom software installation procedures, ...)
* you have finished the [OMD Preparation](installation-omd.md) instructions

We recommend to run Sakuli clients on virtual machines, as they are easy to manage. 

## Preparations
The steps in [Sakuli Client Troubleshooting ("How to make tests more reliable")](troubleshooting-sakuli-client.md) are optional (Sakuli will run even without doing them), but will improve the check quality/reliability. We recommend to do this first and then come back here. 

## Installation of Sakuli
This chapter includes the installation of Sakuli (which already has Sikuli on board) as well as the manual installation of Sahi. 

### Java JRE
* Install Java7 JRE. (Make sure that you do **not install ASK toolbar**, which is enabled by default!)
* Modify PATH: 
	* From the desktop, right-click *My Computer* and click *Properties*
	* In *System Properties*, click on *Advanced*
	* Select the `Path` variable in the Systems Variable section and click *Edit*. Depending on the "Program Files" folder Java is installid in, add one of the following lines to the very end of the string (including the semicolon), apply and reboot: 

			;C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin
			;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin
	

### Sakuli - Install the sakuli-zipped-release
* Download the latest version of Sakuli from  [http://labs.consol.de/sakuli/install](http://labs.consol.de/sakuli/install)
* Unzip the downloaded archive to `C:\\` as destination folder (=it will decompress into `C:\sakuli`). 
* From the desktop, right-click *My Computer* and click *Properties*
	* In *System Properties*, click on *Advanced*
	* Create a new user variable **%SAKULI_HOME%**: 
		* Name: `SAKULI_HOME`
		* Value: `C:\sakuli`
	* Create a new user variable **%PATH%**: 
		* Name: `PATH`
		* Value: `%SAKULI_HOME%\bin\lib\libs`


**Alternative download:** Create a local Sakuli repository by cloning from [https://github.com/ConSol/sakuli/](https://github.com/ConSol/sakuli/).

### Configuration

Some configuration settings in the file `%SAKULI_HOME%\_include\sakuli.properties`: 

#### Encryption:
  * To make usage of the Sakuli encryption feature, set the encryption interface property like `sakuli.encryption.interface=eth3`. For further informations jump to [encryption of secrets](sakuli-manual.md) and come back here.
  * If there is no need of any encryption feature, set the property `sakuli.encryption.interface.testmode=true`.

#### Receivers

Sakuli can send test result to "Receivers", which can be currently GearmanD servers (such as Nagios monitoring systems with mod-gearman) and JDBC databases. If no receiver is defined, a result summary is printed out in the end of a suite. 
  
![sakuli_receivers](../docs/pics/sakuli-receivers.png)

For the configuration of receivers on the OMD server side, see [Receivers in OMD](installation-omd.md#receivers)

Depending on your environment, you probably want to set up on of these two possible receiver types. 

  * [Setting up Sakuli to send results to the Database](receivers/database.md#sakuli-configuration)
  * [Setting up Sakuli to submit results to the Gearman Receiver](receivers/gearman.md#sakuli-configuration)

#### Company proxy	
(optional) Configure your company proxy like described under [Sakuli-Manual - Proxy-Settings](sakuli-manual.md#proxy-settings)

#### Others 
Some further default configuration can be done, see therefore the comments in [sakuli.properties](../core/src/main/_include/sakuli.properties). This default settings will be valid for all test suites of the Sakuli installation. Each single property can be overridden in the property file `testsuite.properties` of the test suite folders as well, see e.g. [testsuite.properties](../sakuli_test_suites/example/testsuite.properties). Overriding of properties makes it possible to configure the behaviour of each test suite individually.

	
### Sahi

* Download the latest version of Sahi from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sahi/files/latest/download?source=files](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sahi/files/latest/download?source=files)
* Unpack the downloaded file and start the installation by double clicking on `install_sahi_v44_20130429.jar`.
	* Installation path: `%SAKULI_HOME%\sahi`
	* select all packages to install

Now it's time to start the Sahi controller for the first time. Open "Start Sahi" from your desktop or from the start menu. 

![startsahi](../docs/pics/w_startsahi.jpg) 	

The Dashboard should list now all available browsers on this system (if not, go to [No browsers in Dashboard](../docs/troubleshooting-sakuli-client.md#no-browsers-in-dashboard): 

![db_browsers](../docs/pics/w_sahi_dashboard_browsers.jpg) 	
Click on any browser you like; Sahi will start it and present the default start page: 

![sahi_start](../docs/pics/sahi_startpage.jpg) 

If neccessary, define now your company's proxy within Sahi: [Proxy settings](../docs/sakuli-manual.md)

Sahi is now installed completely.


### PhantomJS (Optional)
	
Currently, each Sakuli test will start a browser, even for pure Sikuli GUI tests (=where you don't need any browser). In that case, the headless browser *phantomJS* does the trick. 

* Download the latest version of phantomJS from [http://phantomjs.org](http://phantomjs.org)
* Open the ZIP file and copy `phantomjs.exe` to `%SAKULI_HOME%\phantomjs` (create that folder)
* Save [sahi.js](http://labs.consol.de/sakuli/install/3rd-party/phantom/sahi.js) into `%SAKULI_HOME%\phantomjs`

<pre>
	&lt;browserType&gt; 
		&lt;name&gt;phantomjs&lt;/name&gt; 
		&lt;displayName&gt;PhantomJS&lt;/displayName&gt; 
		&lt;icon&gt;safari.png&lt;/icon&gt; 
		&lt;path&gt;C:\sakuli\phantomjs\phantomjs.exe&lt;/path&gt; 
		&lt;options&gt;--proxy=localhost:9999 C:\sakuli\phantomjs\sahi.js&lt;/options&gt; 
		&lt;processName&gt;phantomjs.exe&lt;/processName&gt; 
		&lt;capacity&gt;100&lt;/capacity&gt; 
		&lt;force&gt;true&lt;/force&gt; 
    &lt;/browserType&gt;
</pre>

Now it's time to setup the first Sakuli check: go to [First steps on Windows 7](../docs/firststeps-windows.md).

## Additional tools
### Browser 
Install any of your desired browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, â€¦) and configure them in `browser_types.xml` as described in the [troubleshooting section](../docs/troubleshooting-sakuli-client.md#no-browsers-in-dashboard).

It is recommended to install at least Mozilla Firefox. 
### Greenshot 
To take screenshots which should be used by Sikuli, you need a handy screenshot capturing tool. We highly recommend the installation of [Greenshot](http://www.getgreenshot.org), but any other tool which is able to save screenshots as JPG/PNG is possible, too. 
### Notepad++
Install an advanced text editor to edit Sakuli test cases. We recommend [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
